## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: This will serve as the main page of the application. It should include elements for interacting with the webpage or GUI, such as buttons, input fields, and navigation links.

### Routes

- `/`: This route will be mapped to the `index.html` file. It will handle the display of the main page.
- `/submit`: This route will be responsible for processing any form submissions or interactions from the `index.html` page. It can perform automation tasks, such as:
  - Navigating to specified pages in the GUI or webpage.
  - Clicking specific buttons or elements.
  - Filling out forms and submitting them.
